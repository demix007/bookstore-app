# Bookstore

- This repo contains a bookstore App project. The project lays foundations for the Bookstore website. I created the React part of the app and also set up routing using React Router. I also added redux to the project. 

## Built With

- JavaScript
- React
- Jsx
- CSS

## Getting Started
- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
- Clone this repo to your local machine using `
- cd into the folder and run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
- Run `npm install react-scripts --save` to install scripts to run the react app.
- Run `npm run start` to start the app.
- Open `http://localhost:3000` to view it in the browser.
- The page will reload if you make edits.
- You will also see any lint errors in the console.
- It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
- The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
- Your app is ready to be deployed!
